Mission: The Skyward Scholars Network is devoted to expanding educational opportunities and fostering leadership among underrepresented youth. Our mission is to break down barriers to higher education and empower the next generation of leaders through mentorship, scholarships, and enrichment programs.

Programs:

Mentorship Match: We connect high school students with professional mentors in their fields of interest, providing guidance, career advice, and support throughout their academic journeys. Our mentors help students navigate college applications, career planning, and personal development.

Scholarship Fund: We award merit-based and need-based scholarships to high school graduates pursuing higher education. Our scholarships cover tuition, books, and other educational expenses to help reduce the financial burden on students and their families.

Leadership Labs: These interactive workshops and seminars are designed to build essential skills in leadership, public speaking, and critical thinking. We partner with industry leaders to offer practical advice and real-world experience to our participants.

College Prep Bootcamps: We offer intensive preparatory courses that cover SAT/ACT test-taking strategies, application writing, and interview skills. Our goal is to equip students with the tools they need to succeed in the college admissions process.

Impact: Since launching, the Skyward Scholars Network has provided over $2 million in scholarships, paired more than 3,000 students with mentors, and hosted over 200 leadership and preparation events. Our graduates have gone on to attend prestigious universities and excel in their chosen fields.

Get Involved: Make a difference by volunteering as a mentor, contributing to our scholarship fund, or helping to organize our events. Your support helps create pathways to success for deserving students.
